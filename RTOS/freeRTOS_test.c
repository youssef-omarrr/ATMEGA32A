/*1. Task Scheduling:
    FreeRTOS works by using a scheduler that manages how tasks are executed. 
    Tasks are individual functions that run concurrently, and the scheduler determines when and for how long each task runs.
    There are two main types of scheduling FreeRTOS uses:

    *Preemptive Scheduling: In preemptive mode, the scheduler switches tasks automatically based on priority. 
    Higher-priority tasks can interrupt lower-priority ones, ensuring time-critical tasks are executed as soon as possible.

    *Cooperative Scheduling: In cooperative mode, tasks have to voluntarily give up control of the CPU 
    (e.g., by calling vTaskDelay() or taskYIELD()), and the scheduler will not interrupt them unless they do so.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
2. Tasks
    A task in FreeRTOS is a function written by the programmer that runs concurrently with other tasks. 
    Each task has its own stack (memory space for variables) and can be assigned different priorities. 
    FreeRTOS manages the execution of tasks based on their priority and whether they are ready to run.

Example of task creation:
 * xTaskCreate(TaskFunction, "TaskName", stackSize, parameter, priority, &TaskHandle);

    TaskFunction: The function to be executed.
    stackSize:    The amount of stack memory the task can use.
    parameter:    The argument passed to the task.
    priority:     Determines the order of task execution. Higher priority tasks preempt lower priority ones.
    TaskHandle:   A handle used to reference the task (for deletion, suspension, etc.).

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
3. Task States
Tasks can be in several different states:

*Running: The task is currently being executed by the CPU.
*Ready:   The task is ready to run, but is waiting for the scheduler to give it CPU time.

*Blocked:   The task is waiting for an event to occur (e.g., waiting for a delay to expire, waiting for a semaphore, etc.).
*Suspended: The task has been suspended (manually by calling vTaskSuspend()) and will not be executed until resumed.
*Deleted:   The task has finished or has been deleted by calling vTaskDelete().

The scheduler manages transitions between these states.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
4. Task Priorities
Tasks in FreeRTOS are assigned a priority level (usually an integer). 
 *The higher the priority number, the more "important" the task is. 
 *The scheduler ensures that higher-priority tasks are executed before lower-priority ones.

*If two tasks have the same priority, FreeRTOS uses time-slicing, 
    where the CPU switches between tasks at regular intervals.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5. Time Management
FreeRTOS allows tasks to delay themselves for a certain amount of time, freeing up CPU time for other tasks. 
This is typically done using vTaskDelay():

vTaskDelay(1000); // Delay for 1000 ticks (typically 1 tick = 1 ms)
The vTaskDelay() function puts the task into a blocked state for the specified number of ticks. 
After the delay has passed, the task moves to the ready state, and the scheduler will execute it when possible.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 6. Tick Interrupt
FreeRTOS uses a tick interrupt to manage time. The tick is a periodic interrupt generated by a hardware timer (timer1). 
Each time a tick occurs:
    *The scheduler is invoked to determine whether to switch tasks.
    *Delayed tasks are checked to see if their delay has expired.
    *The tick interrupt is configured by the system, 
     and its frequency determines the "resolution" of the time delays (typically 1ms per tick).
